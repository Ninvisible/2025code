The purpose of this program is to create a simple 2D platformer game in Java where players can control a character that moves, jumps, and interacts with various platforms in a real-time environment. The game is targeted at middle school to high school students who enjoy casual and arcade-style games, especially those with an interest in retro platformers like Super Mario or Doodle Jump. These users likely enjoy quick, engaging challenges and may also have a curiosity about programming or game design. Key features of the game include responsive keyboard controls using Javaâ€™s KeyListener, real-time updates through a Timer-driven game loop, dynamic platform generation and collision handling via a dedicated PlatformManager class, and smooth character movement and jumping mechanics managed by the Player class. To use the program, users simply need to compile the Java source files and run the Main class, after which they can control the player with arrow keys and enjoy the gameplay. The project is organized into clear Java classes: Main for launching the game, BackgroundPanel for graphics and input, PlatformManager for managing the platforms, and Player for character behavior and properties, each designed to support modular development and easy extension of features.
Currently, the tagger does not change to original color when tagging someone else. We learned that Github management can be a struggle at times. Merge errors have plagued our game, so we know now to take a more conservative, step by step approach by pushing each edit consistently. Finally, we give credit to Mr. taylor's code examples for background window and Java API for actionlistener, list, set, arraylist, hashset and mouse movements.
